## Test #2: Improving the TCP Echo Server

    # Connect to server
    nc localhost 5000
    
    # Test commands
    hello

### Advanced Options
1. Port configuration: Allows the port to be set with a --port flag when you are starting the server.
    ```bash
     go run server.go --port 5000
    ```
2. Log all messages from each client with --logdir flag: Saves each clientâ€™s messages to a separate file named after their IP address.
   ```bash
    go run server.go --logdir ./test_logs
    ```
